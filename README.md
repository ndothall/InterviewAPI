üì∑ Interview API
A simple ASP.NET Core 8 Web API for managing camera data, featuring JWT authentication, role-based authorization, and in-memory data storage. This project demonstrates best practices for building APIs, including the use of DTOs, dependency injection, and secure authentication.

üìù Features
CRUD Operations: Manage camera data (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
JWT Authentication: Secure endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
Role-Based Authorization: Restrict access to specific actions based on user roles (Admin, Viewer, etc.).
In-Memory Storage: Uses in-memory storage for simplicity.
Swagger Integration: API documentation and testing via Swagger UI.
